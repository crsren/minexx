Ethical consequences report

There are several ethical consequences that must be considered before we go ahead with our solution. Identifying and working through these consequences is an important part of the solution process. 
-	Previously the artisanal miners traded the minerals they collected to a buyer this was not done as directly as it would with Minexx, these buyers could be negatively affected by the arrival of Minexx, as a result of being removed from the chain. This could have a negative impact on Minexx’s image as a company aiming to fix the supply chain. To overcome this Minexx could employ these buyers as mineral quality checkers or as miners themselves. 
-	If Minexx fails, the communities they were supporting will be hit harder than if Minexx had never been there. This would be because of the miners now depending on Minexx for extra funding. To combat this Minexx could write off the remaining debts of the miners. 
-	Minexx’s involvement could disrupt the local economy by bringing in more money to the area than there was previously. This disruption could cause the supply of commodities in the area to no longer meet demand. A solution to this could be Minexx putting a cap on the amount each miner can take out of the fund.
-	Another possible ethical consequence is some miners taking out loans with no intent to pay them back. This would cause a number of issues, firstly the miners paying back their loans will feel cheated, also the people who are investing in Minexx’s ATIF will potentially withdraw their investment. Minexx’s MineSmart platform should be enough of a deterrent as with the identification information on each miner available, those not willing to pay can have their access to the fund removed or be reported to the authorities. 
-	Do Minexx check what the miners spend their money? There could be a backlash against them if for example the equipment the miners purchase using the fund is faulty. A way that the risk of this could be reduced would be for Minexx to make a list of reputable providers of things such as machinery, safety equipment and tools. 
-	There is the risk of corruption, this would look bad on Minexx with their aim being to bring transparency to the supply chain. However, this is much reduced through Minexx having information on all the miners and working on the blockchain meaning all transactions can be observed.
-	With the use of the ATIF to bring electricity to the mine sites the miners will have to be educated on electrical hazards and safety. Minexx will have to ensure that electrical equipment is satisfactorily labelled with cautions and that all miners using the equipment know how to use it safely.
-	The ATIF will also be used for the purchase of machinery such as diggers. For the miners safety Minexx will have to ensure that they are provided with the appropriate training required to operate said machinery.
