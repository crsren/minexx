# Methodology

One unique aspect of the group project with Minexx was the amount of freedom we were given, both with regards to the specific problem we want to address, as well as the solution we propose. The open-ended nature of the project specification made the work more interesting, but also much more challenging. Before developing any product, we had to figure out what the product should be, and before that even, what the product should address. Also, working on topics such as web development or security tokens, both of which we knew little about beforehand, forced us to plan our goals with caution: Developing in a new environment and with a new programming language always takes more time than anticipated.

With these two special requirements in mind, we decided to work according to Agile methodologies, using Design Thinking in the the ideation and conceptualization process and organizing tasks in Kanban boards throughout the development process. This document will further explain how we worked, the methodologies we used and our rationale behind them.

### Notion

We organized all notes, resources and communication using [Notion.so](http://notion.so), an all-in-one productivity solution. Notion has been chosen for multiple reasons. First, it is built around a shared database, thus allowing us to share sources and notes so that everyone is on the same page with the status of the project. This database also has an integrated Kanban and Calendar view, which allowed us to schedule and track both tasks and meetings as a team instead of individually. Furthermore, Notion allows team members to remotely edit meeting notes together and has an extensive communication channel built in, allowing the group to tag and notify each other about any issues.

### Agile Development

Given the open-ended nature of the project, we decided to approach the development process iteratively. The main rationale behind this decision was to remain flexible to the needs of the process, especially as we knew we would work with unseen technology. This gave us room to run into  unexpected problems or to change part of our project completely. To illustrate this, here are two of the original values of the [Agile manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org) and the principles behind them:

- **Responding to change over following a plan**

    Welcome changing requirements, even late in
    development. Agile processes harness change for
    the customer's competitive advantage.

    Working software is the primary measure of progress.

- **Individuals and interactions over processes and tools**

    The most efficient and effective method of
    conveying information to and within a development
    team is face-to-face (in our case, screen-to-screen) conversation.

Simply put, planning the development process far in advance was impossible given our inexperience with the technologies we had to use, and so working agile allowed us to account for the many suprises we anticipated.

To give an example, styling the [minexx.codes](http://minexx.codes) webpage required more than five times as much work as anticipated. Our inexperience with CSS lead us to underestimate both the amount of work needed as well as the time we required per line of code since we had to look up many new concepts. However, by following an Agile methodology, this had no further consequences to the overall development plan as the team communicated frequently instead of developing larger, complicated parts in-parallel.

### Kanban boards

The search for a lightweight, iterative development framework ultimately came down to a decision between [Scrum](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-scrum) [2] and Kanban. We believe Kanban is the better fit for our project and have successfully applied it throughout. Here is why [1]: 

- Large, complicated projects are broken down into **smaller, more manageable tasks**. This helped us stay flexible and orient ourselves when developing with new tools and technologies.
- The **visual overview** using Kanban cards allowed us to see all the work to be done and what the other group members are currently working on.
- Kanban does not dictate structured roles within a team, allowing us to **collaborate on all topics**. We still declared a person responsible for single tasks, but minimized splitting the work completely as much as possible.

Below is a picture of how we used Kanban boards for project development. We used the three standard columns "Not Started", "In Progress" and "Completed" as well as an additional "On Hold" column for features that we started developing but paused as they required more time or were found to be more complicated intended.

In addition, we kept separate notes for every significant meeting, allowing the team to quickly find relevant sources and notes by day. We have compiled our Notion meeting notes into this repository here [Link].
